 * \mainpage QtcDev plugin: Qt Creator plugin to develop plugins.
 *
 * \section features Features
 * Here is a list of the current features of the plugin (see also \ref future for further devopments):
 *  \li Allows to start Qt Creator with the current version of the plugin loaded
 *  \li Allows to test the current version of the plugin
 *  \li Auto-detection of plugin build output dir (\c DESTDIR) and install dir
 *  \li Tuning theme settings path and working directory of test instance
 *
 * \section future Planned developments
 * Here are some ideas I plan to implement later:
 *  \li Select test(s) to run
 *  \li Full configuration of the test Qt Creator instance
 *  \li Selection of the loaded plugin for the test Qt Creator instance
 *
 * If you have any other feature you will be interested in, please let me know.
 * I will be pleased to develop it if I think it is a must have.
 *
 * If you want to implement extension, also tell me please. Admittedly you
 * can do what you desire with the code (under the constraints stated in the
 * section \ref license below), but this will avoid double work.
 *

 * It also contains the slots which manage the available versions of the
 * plugin being developped (relying on the information contained in
 * QtcRunConfiguration and QtcTestRunConfiguration).
 *
 * It proposes tests for the functionnality of the whole plugin.
